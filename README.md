🔐 FortiGate NGFW Security Implementation & SOC-Oriented Monitoring Project

Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in configuring and monitoring a Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) using Fortinet FortiGate within a simulated enterprise environment.

The focus was not only on firewall configuration, but also on building a security monitoring workflow aligned with SOC operations, including traffic inspection, threat detection, log analysis, and security event evaluation.

🎯 SOC-Focused Objectives

Implement layered network defense mechanisms

Configure and validate security policies

Enable deep traffic inspection

Monitor real-time network activity

Analyze security logs for anomaly detection

Evaluate threat severity using risk-based scoring

🏗 Enterprise Security Architecture

The environment simulated a segmented enterprise network including:

Internal LAN

External WAN

Security Zones

Policy-controlled traffic flow

Centralized logging and monitoring

Network segmentation and access control were implemented following the least privilege principle to reduce attack surface exposure.
